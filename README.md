03 Password Generator

## Project Description
For this project I had to create a website that automatically generated a password composed of random characters. The length and type of characters that are included in the password are to be determined by user choice via prompts after clicking a "generate password" button. 

## What I Learned
This project helped me learn a lot about for loops and when they should be applied in websites. I also learned a lot about how arrays and arrays within arrays interact and what methods we can use to manipulate them. However, I think that I made my system overly complex by making too many arrays rather than just having them be strings and concatanating them together. I also learned that it's often very useful to declare variables and leaving them empty at the beginning of the page and then filling them with values later on, it seems to make the script look and feel cleaner.

## Difficulties that I had
=Undefined Outputs=
    I had a lot of trouble having some values be "undefined" on the website after going through my calculator. I will need to figure out why that is happening in the near future.
